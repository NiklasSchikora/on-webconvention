Page layouts are placed in the layouts/ directory and will be automatically
loaded via asynchronous import when used. If you create a layouts/default.vue
this will be used for all pages in your app. Other layouts are used by setting
a layout property as part of your component options.

If you have only single layout for application, you can alternatively use app.vue .
